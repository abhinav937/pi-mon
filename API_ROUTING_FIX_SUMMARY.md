# Frontend API Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The frontend was only working when making API requests with the port number (e.g., `http://65.36.123.68:5001/api/system/enhanced`) but not without it (e.g., `http://65.36.123.68/api/system/enhanced`).

## Root Cause
The nginx configuration was incorrectly stripping the `/api/` prefix when forwarding requests to the backend. The `proxy_pass` directive was set to `http://127.0.0.1:5001/` (with trailing slash), which caused nginx to remove the `/api/` part before forwarding.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Nginx Configuration (`nginx/pi-monitor.conf`)
- **Before**: `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5001/;` (incorrect - strips /api/ prefix)
- **After**: `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/;` (correct - preserves /api/ prefix)

- Added comprehensive proxy configuration for all API endpoints
- Added CORS handling for preflight requests
- Added security headers
- Added fallback routing for endpoints without /api/ prefix

### 2. Updated Production Configuration (`frontend/src/config/production.js`)
- Changed `BACKEND_PORT` from 5001 to 80 (nginx proxy port)
- Added comprehensive endpoint definitions
- Added debug configuration options
- Ensured all endpoints use the nginx proxy (port 80)

### 3. Fixed Direct API Calls in Components
- **SystemStatus.js**: Replaced direct `fetch()` call with unified client method
- Added `getSystemInfo()` method to unified client for consistency

### 4. Enhanced Unified Client (`frontend/src/services/unifiedClient.js`)
- Added `getSystemInfo()` method
- Ensured all API calls go through the unified client
- Maintained proper error handling and logging

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend Request**: `http://65.36.123.68/api/system/enhanced`
2. **Nginx Receives**: Request on port 80
3. **Nginx Forwards**: To `http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/system/enhanced`
4. **Backend Receives**: Full path with `/api/` prefix intact
5. **Response**: Flows back through nginx to frontend

## Benefits

- ✅ All API requests now work without specifying port numbers
- ✅ Consistent routing through nginx proxy
- ✅ Better security with proper headers
- ✅ CORS support for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Centralized API management through unified client
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify all endpoints:
```bash
chmod +x test_api_endpoints.sh
./test_api_endpoints.sh
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update nginx configuration** (already done)
2. **Reload nginx** on your server:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration
   sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Apply changes
   ```
3. **Rebuild frontend** if needed:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

## Verification

After applying these changes, both of these should work:
- ✅ `http://65.36.123.68/api/system/enhanced` (through nginx proxy)
- ✅ `http://65.36.123.68:5001/api/system/enhanced` (direct backend access)

The frontend will now use the nginx proxy by default, eliminating the need for port numbers in API URLs.
